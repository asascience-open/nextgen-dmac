# Opportunities

## Supporting and Educating the IOOS Community

### System Integrations

## Growing an Inclusive Open-Source Community

This project made it possible for software engineers from many different organizations to collaborate toward a common goal. It is not uncommon for developers in the NOAA community to be independently building very similar software solutions. In the end we are all working toward better serving NOAA data to our unique clients. 

We should practice good community management to continue these open-source efforts and collaborations. 

## Serving Cloud-Native Data

## Managing Data Quality

## Viewing One IOOS

## Preparing for Rapid Evolution




## AI-Ready Data

While we are focused on transforming IOOS data, AI is an important use-case that should not be ignored.
