## Background

This public repository maintains prototype code and documentation describing the efforts and direction related to the project, "Reaching for the Cloud: Architecting a Cloud-Native Service-Based Ecosystem for DMAC." The goal of this project is to identify the technological and process shifts needed to develop a cloud-native architecture that will serve the current and future needs of the IOOS community. We will be testing a variety of technologies to identify more efficient cloud processing, storage, and data collection options while experimenting with cloud-native architectural patterns to bring it all together.

For a great resource explaining the background information for the Next-Gen DMAC project, check out [This Slideshow.](https://github.com/asascience-open/nextgen-dmac/blob/main/docs/DMAC%20NextGen%20Background%20Info.pdf)

We hosted a [DMAC Tech Webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8E2wQk3k8A) in June 2023 explaining some of the results of the project so far.
