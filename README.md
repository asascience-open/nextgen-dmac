## Background

This public repository maintains prototype code and documentation describing the efforts and direction related to the project, "Reaching for the Cloud: Architecting a Cloud-Native Service-Based Ecosystem for DMAC." The goal of this project is to identify the technological and process shifts needed to develop a cloud-native architecture that will serve the current and future needs of the IOOS community. We will be testing a variety of technologies to identify more efficient cloud processing, storage, and data collection options while experimenting with cloud-native architectural patterns to bring it all together.
