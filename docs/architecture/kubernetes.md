# Kubernetes

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is an infrastructure and container orchestration tool that enables organizations to effectively run and manage cloud-native services. It solves a number of challenges that organizations run into as they embark on their cloud-native journey. Like any technology solution, it must also be properly governed and managed to obtain the most benefit and avoid pitfalls.

These are some of the problems that Kubernetes solves:

- Managing, provisioning, and scaling servers
- Managing and configuring the network infrastructure for those servers
- Managing many running containers
- Networking between interdependent containers
- Scaling services up and down based on workload
- Optimizing costs for running services
- True cloud-agnostic platform: Kubernetes can be run on AWS, Azure, and GCP
- Enables federated deployments on multiple cloud platforms
