# Next-Gen DMAC
### Next-Generation Data Management and Cyberinfrastructure
#### A collaboration between [RPS Group Ocean Science](https://www.rpsgroup.com/services/oceans-and-coastal/) and the NOAA Integrated Ocean Observing System ([IOOS](https://ioos.noaa.gov/))
This public repository will describe the prototyping efforts and direction of the Next-Gen DMAC project, "Reaching for the Cloud: Architecting a Cloud-Native Service-Based Ecosystem for DMAC."

This repository is intended to be a collaborative working area for open discussion about cloud-based services for ocean science. Please feel welcome to start a [Discussion](https://github.com/asascience-open/nextgen-dmac/discussions), contribute your ideas, and even contribute to our prototyping efforts!
